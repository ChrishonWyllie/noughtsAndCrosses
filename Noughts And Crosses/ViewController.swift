            //as a tag
            
            /**IMPORTANT*******
            When you select all tags between 0 and 9, you must remember that some
            things in the viewController have specified 0 as their tag by default. 
            Examples include the game board, the buttons, labels and ANY OTHER ITEM 
            DRAGGED onto the viewController will have 0 as a their tag number by default.
            
            So when the game finishes, the app will crash when a user wins because this code
            will attempt to convert all items with tag numbers between 0 and 9 to buttons.
            UIimage views, labels, etc. will crash the app when they an attempt to
            convert to buttons is made on them.
            
            To prevent this, go back through the main storyboard and make sure that only specific
            items have tags within the range of 0 to 9 (or any number you specify). 
            Change the others to 10 or higher in this case

        Notice that we have used sender.setImage instead of button.setImage(the name of the image/button was called "button" but as an IBOutlet)
        
        YOU MUST CONTROL CLICK AND DRAG EVERY BUTTON TO THE METHOD!
        
        This means that we "sent" this method to every object linked
        to it, by specifying "sender" instead of a explicitly named object.

        /*ADDITIONALLY IMPORTANT x2*****
        
        You can specify the tag of an image or button in order directly 
        manipulate it here in code. This is located by clicking on the 
        image/button/etc, scrolling down to view and choosing a number for "tag"
        Every button has been set to a number from 0 - 8. (An array of 9 spaces begins with 0-8)
        

        Using the "sender.tag" method tells the sender to find which tag it is referring to when pressed.
        So, once a button is pressed, the tag reference number is passed to the gameState array. 
        Basically, if the position in the array/game is empty ( = 0), then run the code that changes the
        image. Otherwise do nothing. This prevents the ability for players to change previous turns decisions.
