Tic-tac-toe simulation using Xcode 7 , Swift 2 and iOS9.


WARNING: I document just about every line of code in this project simply for the purpose of being able to re-read it 
later at some point. I was learning these concepts while writing the code so I wanted to be able to remember 
it whenever I opened the project. It may look sloppy...or very green...
